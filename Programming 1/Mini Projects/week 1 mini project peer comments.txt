peer 4 ? Great job! As I mentioned, the variable name misspelling was the only issue, but it didn't cost you any points. For what it's worth, you also have an option to tweak your code that might help in later programs. Looking at your code that identifies the winner, you might want to consider using "elif" and "else" after your first "if" statement ("if winner == 0:"). Using them will make debugging your program logic MUCH easier in certain cases when you get to more complex programs. The current chain of "if" statements, while correct in this case, can lead to logic failures in other circumstances that make it difficult to track down. Also, you might want to consider combining the conditions so that all of the conditions that lead to the same result are on the same line. For example, "winner == 1 or winner == 2" as a single condition check is more manageable than two separate checks on two separate lines, "winner == 1" and "winner == 2". Keep up the excellent work! Good luck...
